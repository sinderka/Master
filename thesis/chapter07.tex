\section{Further work}
The implemented test problems has some limitations. It could be interesting to see how the error and energy behaved with a random Hamiltonian matrix, with a known analytical solution. \\

Graphics cards are designed to solve $4 \times 4$ matrices in parallel \cite{!!!!!!!}. When the energy is constant windowing can be used to ensure convergence with this $n$. This could then be used to solve non linear Hamiltonian problems in parallel under optimized conditions. \\



\section{Conclusion}
Use windowing with expm, and not restart!
