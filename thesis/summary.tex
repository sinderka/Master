\section*{Summary and Conclusions}
Projection methods are methods that can transform big linear systems to a smaller linear systems with similar properties. 
Two such methods (the symplectic Lanczos method (\texttt{SLM}) and the Krylov projection method (\texttt{KPM})) are compared to each other on linear Hamiltonian differential equations. The behavior of error, energy as a function of time is examined. Computation time for the different methods are also shown.  \\
The projection methods are also compered to each other on non autonomous linear Hamiltonian differential equation.\\

\noindent Energy preservation for the symplectic Lanczos method is proved under some assumptions, along with convergence for both projection methods. \texttt{SLM} has no advantage over \texttt{KPM} in error estimation. On autonomous systems the computation times for \texttt{SLM} and \texttt{KPM} are similar, and both methods can be well utilized. On non autonomous systems \texttt{KPM} is much faster than \texttt{SLM}. Since it has a comparable error and energy estimate \texttt{KPM} might be considered a better choice in this case.
