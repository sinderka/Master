\chapter{SLM energy preservation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It can be proved that a restart of SLM does not alter the energy. This chapter is devoted to showing that this is true.

The residual energy of the symplectic Lanzcos method is
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} e_r^{\top} J A e_r + e_r^\top J r_{n+1} e_{2n}^\top z
\end{equation}
with $ e_r = y-y_n $ (analytical solution minus approximated solution) and $r_{n+1}$ is the residual vector given by the symplectic Lanzcos method.

\end{figure}

The figures above implies that restarting the symplectic Lanzcos method does indeed not change the energy. But for Arnoldi's method it changes quite a bit. 

The figures below shows the difference between the symplectic Lanczos method with and without restart.

        \label{fig:intconv}
\end{figure}
The figure above shows very little difference in energy with SLM, even with several restarts. \\


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bilde av hvordan dette ser ut for arnoldi?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ARG, hva m√• jeg ha med for at dette skal bli mer overbevisende?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
