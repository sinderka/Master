We will now show some numerical experiments using a randomly generated Hamiltonian matrix(\texttt{semirandom}).\\

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sammenligne tid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sammenlige iterasjoner?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sammenligne feil !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sammenligne energi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\
